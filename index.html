<h2>About Civil Air Patrol</h2>

<p> I am involved in a program that is involved in aviation the program's name is <a href="http://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/">Civil Air Patrol</a>. Civil Air Patrol is an official auxiliary to the U.S Air Force, a program that helps in emergency services and is a volunteer program. This program focus on trust respect and responsibility, of course since they are an auxiliary to the Air Force they represent the Air Force. Civil Air Patrol train do drills, and exercise similar to the U.S Air Force. The Civil Air Patrol host events similar to a bootcamp it�s called CTW the main point of this event is to teach discipline, leadership, and drills.</p>

<h2>Where they mostly volunteer</h2>

<p> Civil Air Patrol or CAP for short, helps out with local events they especially help a local organization called <a href="http://www.tripletreeaerodrome.com/">Triple Tree Aerodrome</a>. Triple Tree is located in woodruff, and it is an airport but with no paved airstrip this organization holds aviation events like �fly in� where aircraft from different parts of history land on their grass airstrip. CAP helps with maintenance of this airport, we help maintain trees also clean the pavements of the buildings located there. CAP gives triple tree  their services and in return triple tree gives CAP discounts on their food and CAP is free to fly in their gliders, CAP is given free access to triple tree�s events. Triple tree benefits greatly from the help given it shortens the time it would take for them to get it done.</p>

<h2>What and where are their activities</h2>

<p>CAP travels to different parts of the state from charleston, columbia, and etc even out of state mostly north carolina. The reason why CAP visits different parts of the state is for the historic value of the sites. CAP wants their cadets to be aware of the history in South Carolina, mostly the aviation is what they focus on but they also learn about past wars and weapons used and historic artifacts. The aviation is learning about planes and the history behind them and what war they were in and how they were used. CAP doesn�t always do historic they have fun where they're at, the last time they went to charleston after visiting a historic site as a reward they went to an aquarium.</p>

<h2>More about CAP</h2>

<p>CAP benefits all ages above twelve years of age. Even if your below twelve you can you can benefit and be a future cadet. Above for example thirteen you can be a cadet and learn what CAP has to teach, if your dream is to be involved in aviation this program can help with planning your aviation career military or civilian. If you�re older or an adult and your future is already set the program can still benefit you for example, you can get your pilot's license this program can help there and you can use this program to have something to do like learn about aviation.</p>
